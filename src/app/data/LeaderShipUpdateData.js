Our P1 priorities are aligned to our business strategy and essential for globalizing and standardizing our business. We also have many other essential initiatives that must run in the background to keep our business running day to day.</p><p><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1186/582;width:62.37%;\" src=\"https://strapi-bus-eng-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/blog_table_001_704ccf7bc8.png\" alt=\"blog table.001.png\" width=\"1186\" height=\"582\"></p><p><br>I’m happy to have already seen a lot of success across our priorities in H1. We’ve made great headway on rolling out SSG across Europe — launching UK, Spain and just this last week Italy, with Germany to come in H2 and France planned for January. Workday is now global and we continue to roll out and improve enhancements to make work even more seamless. From a security perspective, we’re starting to trial how we manage third-party access via Okta, using an updated access model, removing unneeded licenses, and significantly reducing costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many teams across Technology have worked to reduce legacy systems, platforms, and software over the last few years and Enterprise Technology is no exception. We continue to work toward eliminating as many legacy systems as possible to reduce complexities, drive standardization, and increase our security measures. All of the priorities listed above aim to remove barriers that will make it easier for people across Condé Nast to do their jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Driving Efficiency &amp; Productivity</strong><br>We aim to increase efficiency and productivity this year by completing some of the reorganization work we started last year, reducing AWS and licensing costs, and implementing more AI-driven tools. Global Support and Infrastructure merged into one team under Chris Simms to further boost existing natural synergies between the two groups. Global Support has also worked to bring all onsite support teams under one global function, most recently welcoming Spain Onsite Support to the team.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From a tools perspective, it’s our job to uncover the value within the hype around AI. We started by exploring Google Gemini but realized it was still too early in the tool’s maturity for us to use it in an efficient way. We pivoted to diving deeper into the AI tools offered by Zoom and are looking forward to piloting AI-driven meeting summaries imminently. We’re also looking into using AI to power a virtual chat agent to help point people in the right direction for knowledge articles and Support help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Raising In-Team Visibility, Responsibility, and Growth Opportunities</strong><br>The last area I’m focused on is elevating my teams’ and leaders’ engagement within Enterprise Technology. I’m very fortunate to have such fantastic leaders and managers and my goal is to raise visibility around the great work they’re doing and get them more involved in higher-level leadership discussions where relevant. I’m committed to supporting my teams in finding the best development opportunities and the right avenues for career growth.&nbsp;<br>–</p><p><br>My teams across Enterprise Platforms, Global Support, Cybersecurity, and Digital Communications and Meeting &amp; Events have cascaded the goals outlined above into their own objectives this year — finding innovative ways to create more value in their respective fields. I encourage you to tune into this week’s Look Back / Look Forward sessions to learn more.</p>",

We were encouraged to see that&nbsp;<strong>60%</strong> of you across both scrum and non-scrum teams answered with a 9 or 10 for both questions. One of Leadership’s goals this year is to raise engagement scores at an individual level on Glint and a team level on our Health surveys. Our Glint engagement score for Technology is 67, so with actions taken in response to your feedback and an increased response rate, we hope to begin building on this score.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#252526;font-family:'Libre Franklin',sans-serif;\"><img class=\"image_resized\" style=\"aspect-ratio:596/255;width:70.42%;\" src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXefoDkvA2guzFnvJn-Oqj4--nDQCihiTb0ekdJQM5rKx7CmP37Kmm8v-8CRhi67iDjEnd7qoVgBE0hl4tGV6oRwyRqwGuO9ynsMcQTt4fWDyaenkxZfxmJ5CJS4r5IUsS63yCAmHW8zWwH-XJMtKZzUVWI?key=uETBe9jONqRVvjmd1tBDQg\" width=\"596\" height=\"255\"></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);font-family:'Libre Franklin',sans-serif;\">Our survey results showed that distributed agile methods are where we could improve the most; followed by planning and delivery.

                "Text": "<h2><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">What it Means to Treat Data As an Asset</span></h2><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Teams across Condé Nast are committed to creating a better customer experience to drive more engagement. To do that successfully, the company must treat data as an asset. When we do, we can establish the right risk management and governance, create more value around our data, and build a better understanding of who our customers are and what they want. Treating data as an asset is critical for any organization, but especially one anchored in the digital world. I outline below how I plan to grow our data’s value and influence across our company this year.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Improve Privacy Compliance, Governance, &amp; Cookie Consent Starting in High-Risk Markets</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">This goal first and foremost minimizes risk. Compliance refers to defining the specific purpose for why we collect the data we do. Once the purpose is identified, we need to understand where our data is stored, who’s using it, and whether it’s being used for the right purpose — that’s governance. There are different regulations and policies across markets, especially in Europe due to GDPR, that we must ensure that we’re compliant against. We’ll use a phased approach to address compliance in each market based on risk level and partner with Consumer, Commercial, Audience Development, and Editorial to define use cases for our data; Engineering and Ad Tech to understand and document the systems capturing the requested data; and Privacy and Legal to ensure we’re following regulation.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">We’ll improve privacy compliance and governance through:</span><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Data mapping</strong>: one single understanding of where data is collected, used, and flows through our systems.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Register of Processing Activities (ROPA)</strong>: establish one register where all the data sits when a user gives us personal information like name and email. A ROPA allows us to easily manage customer rights so that it’s easy to find and show customers what data we have and delete data if they request to do so.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Data minimization policies</strong>: limit the amount of personal information we collect by intentionally defining why each piece of data is necessary. The goal is to reduce risks like data breaches, unauthorized access, and misuse of personal data.</span></li><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Cookie governance and auditing:</strong> proactively monitor data to ensure that we drop the right cookies without breaching compliance and delete required data afterward so that we’re compliant with our policy.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">My team will lead cookie consent management — which is when we ask our customers if they agree to us collecting a certain amount of data from them. Though cookie consent differs across countries and US states, we see 30-40% of readers across the EU deny cookies, which means we lose a substantial portion of insights from our population. We hope to reduce this percentage through well-understood and managed consent strategies to reduce the impact cookie consent currently has on our company.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Improve Efficiency and Data Literacy Across Condé Nast Through Better Insights Platform (Business Intelligence and Analytics) and Processes That Promote Standardization.</strong></span><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">To universally treat data as an asset, we need to build trust in our data by determining a single definition and way to measure our top-level KPIs — time spent, monetizable ad impressions, and page views. Right now, we use too many tools across the organization and markets like DASH, Pars.ly, Google Analytics, Looker, etc. We aim to create a single source of dashboards for our decision-makers, minimizing our tools to increase efficiency, reduce cost, and standardize our data. The Data Solutions Engineering team has done fantastic work to make our data available via Databricks in our data platform, now all the data we collect from Snowplow, CDPs, Google Ad Manager, etc. needs to live in that same ecosystem. Once our data is in one place, the next step is to ensure that everyone consistently uses that data with standard definitions and dashboards.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>Connect the Data Governance &amp; Insight team closer to the Business and Support Transition of Data Science &amp; Product Analytics to Oscar Celma.</strong></span><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">I was pleased to see my teams’ positive feedback from the Glint survey and it helped me identify areas that I think we could still improve. First, I aim to better communicate how the team’s day-to-day tasks connect to what the larger organization is driving toward. Our teams do incredibly meaningful work and it’s important that we can connect it back to measurable OKRs that align with both our data and larger company strategy. Tasks here include broadening exposure to teams outside of our own, acting as a proactive consultant vs. reactive service role, putting together intentional cross-functional working groups, and holding ourselves accountable for the impact our work will have on our larger company objectives.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Next, I’m excited to see the investment Condé Nast has made in data and welcome Oscar Celma to the Technology leadership team as SVP of Data Science and Product Analytics. I will support him and the Data Science and Product Analytics teams to transition smoothly under his leadership and look forward to continuing to partner closely with them to strengthen our data strategy and build up dynamic user experiences.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">A personal goal of mine is to establish a strong data strategy and educate others, starting with senior leadership, about what we can achieve with our data. I’ve seen encouraging growth in awareness for more complicated data topics (eg. consent management, privacy compliance etc) and want to continue to lead the charge in identifying gaps where we can partner to deliver solutions.&nbsp;</span></p>",

Our industry is massively shifting — we can no longer rely on old distribution and engagement methods, namely big Tech platforms, &nbsp;and are under pressure to develop better distribution strategies and drive more aggressive engagement once we attract users. We ultimately hope to strengthen and better communicate our company’s value proposition with customers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">With that in mind, I’m committed to the following goals:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>1. Evolve foundational capabilities around experimentation, single customer view, and dynamic user segments.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">The headline here is making experiences better on smaller screens so that users are more engaged and we can monetize more effectively by moving users into a “known” category. This goal is fundamental to activating our dynamic user experiences (‘the fly by’, ‘the shopper’, and ‘the loyal subscriber’). We continue to do great work to raise the visibility of Design and its crucial role within our organization, particularly focusing on the Unified Customer View, and how we actually design for those dynamic experiences. To get here, teams need to embrace a culture of frequent experimentation and testing. We are doing solid work building our universe of known users and rolling out processes around experimentation so it's better structured and prioritized through Growthbook, testing forums, and more. &nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Keep the following in mind when testing:</span><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Comparing impact vs. lift, which helps us prioritize the most important tests</span></li><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Prioritizing ways of moving unknown users to known through registration and subscriptions</span></li><li><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Identifying which content types drive the most conversion</span><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Data Science and Taxonomy teams are critical in our work to identify key customer segments and deliver personalized experiences, propelling us closer to strategies underpinned by data. We can better advise our stakeholders across Consumer and Commercial Revenue through more sophisticated testing that measures outcomes based on various trade-offs across revenue lines (ex. We’re seeing that users coming from social media have a higher tolerance for ads, so we can offer a higher ad density experience).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>2. Drive better communication and a sense of purpose across the org, such that employees understand how their work fits into the broader picture.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Glint results were clear – improve our teams’ understanding of how their roles relate to the broader Condé ecosystem and objectives. When I think of solidifying a sense of “purpose” across Product, Design, and Technology as a whole, to me people must understand why the work they’re doing is important and how it contributes to advancing company goals. Technology's integration into the company's vision and priorities is chiefly guided by our</span> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BcVerKhPm7VvSOdss6GvRhwiYCg-E7pinEM1JCf0FCo/edit#gid=1638240524\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"color:hsl(240,75%,60%);\"><u>Global OKR framework</u></span></a><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">, revisited every six months.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">I’m committed to more frequent communication of our vision at Product &amp; Design all-hands that now occur monthly, operationalizing the global OKR dashboard to increase transparency and showcase how teams’ work ties into our OKRs, and evolving the LB/LF summary decks that we started this past February. We will give more frequent functional updates across our four focus areas (engagement, revenue, customer data, and publishing) and continue driving awareness on the design side to articulate how good user research, content design, and product design help us get closer to being great destinations for our customers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>3. Leverage our Global Objectives in driving impactful initiatives with more attention to dates.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Per usual, I’m focused on rigorously sticking to our agreed-upon OKRs and even more so on adhering to launch dates. I aim to be even better about aligning and setting expectations with cross-functional stakeholders about deadlines and dates. We work in an environment that is by necessity both agile and waterfall. Dates are attached to tentpoles that we need to work hard to meet, while also working in scrum teams that are dedicated to agile processes. &nbsp;It’s hard but we need to push rigor while also espousing a test and learn culture.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>4. Raise the bar on my ability to measure what I talk about internally.</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">We need to get better on metrics. That’s the bottom line, as an organization and as a personal goal for myself. When I say “get better” I mean things like disambiguating time spent and LTV to more seamlessly incorporate them as target metrics within projects and better understand how they impact the company’s bottom line.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Steps for improvement are fully implementing Snowplow, agreeing on definitions, and pushing Snowplow to feed into our dashboards through ever-evolving data models. Testing is needed to understand the incremental impact of our work on time spent. Right now, we look at time spent overall by brand or story page, but we don’t have a sense of how effective one feature vs. another was on time spent. This is a big opportunity for Product and Design to raise the bar, set metrics at the beginning, seek training from product analytics, and fish more for their own data.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\"><strong>5. Build habituation with compelling destinations that help pivot our business model.&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><br><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">Our engagement teams are no longer just brand teams, they’re also focused on community, audio, video, and live events, resulting in a more holistic view of our owned and operated (O&amp;O) experiences that we pilot on brands, with the idea to scale where relevant to other brands in the network). Teams across all four focus areas have a role to play in driving new features that create compelling O&amp;O destinations, asking themselves — would people come back for this? Pay for this? Are we building experiences using good UX principles and governance? &nbsp;Our publishing teams have highly discerning customers in our editors who need constantly improved tools to help them do their jobs better to create digital experiences worthy of their brands.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">These are the questions we can answer through segmentation, understanding user habits, and measurement of repeat visitation from known users, LTV, enterprise value, and time spent. My goal is that we pivot our business model from one that's reliant on anonymous, scaled usage to one that’s based on known, repeat visitation and payment. We should all strive to shift our thinking to how we can prioritize and scale features and capabilities across brands. &nbsp;Going forward, continuing to simplify our stack while we scale into new global markets, harmonize our templates, and unify domains where we can is imperative. &nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">—</span></p><p><span style=\"color:hsl(0,0%,100%);\">I’m really excited about the phenomenal work done so far in H1 and look forward to diving into H2 planning. I encourage you all across Technology to support and challenge each other, ask the right questions, and develop your own viewpoint that’s numbers-backed and expressed clearly.</span></p>",

This is a central space for our Technology community so you can learn more about your colleagues, find crucial resources that set you up for success both in your day-to-day work and longer-term in your careers, and keep up with the latest updates, news, presentations, and more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>One of our global OKRs for this year is to enhance the employee experience, and this Technology hub is just one of many initiatives dedicated to engaging our employees. The Technology Hub is a brand new communication channel that can be used to culminate the majority of our communications in one place. We’ll continue to scale the hub over H1 to add more valuable features and improve users’ experience.<br>This is meant to be a dynamic space that grows and evolves with our teams so I ask that each of you contribute and play a part in making it your own — whether it’s adding more resources (<a href=\"https://forms.gle/mqpmQykbbGgkGbF56\"><u>submit requests here</u></a>) or suggesting your favorite song or TV show (<a href=\"https://forms.gle/xW93cUaX6YN3Q73K9\"><u>submit recommendations here</u></a>) — the hub should be everyone’s go-to place to connect with your Technology community.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:brooke_mustain@condenast.com\"><u>Brooke Mustain</u></a> on the Technology Engagement team if you have any questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sanjay</p>",
